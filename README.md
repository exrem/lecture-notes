## Contributing

As you might expect, I don't accept any contributions related to the content (cuz they're **my** notes, duh; and this is not a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)) but if you'd like to suggest some improvements related to the tech stack, or design of the website itself, or fixing some typos (or any mistakes I've made), any issue/pull request is welcomed!
